One of the errors we often encounter on Windows is the libraries not appearing despite being installed. To prevent this, we need to perform very simple installation and installation checks


For example, we installed the opencv library, but it's not visible.


- I did pip install opencv-python, but it still didn't appear in my library.


Follow the steps below step by step.

"""

pip install opencv-python,

pip3 install opencv-python,

pip install opencv-python --user,

python -m pip install --upgrade opencv-python,

python3 -m pip install --upgrade opencv-python,

py -m pip install opencv-python
